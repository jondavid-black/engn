# Welcome to Digital Engine

Digital Engine (`engn`) is an intelligent engine designed for modern engineering and program management. It provides a robust foundation for building, architecting, and managing complex systems through model-driven definitions.

## Getting Started

To initialize a new project, you can use the `engn` CLI:

```bash
engn init --name "My Project"
```

This will set up the necessary project structure and configuration files to begin your engineering journey.
