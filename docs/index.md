# Welcome to Digital Engine

Digital Engine (`digengn`) is a comprehensive suite of intelligent tools designed for modern engineering and program management. It provides a robust foundation for building, architecting, and managing complex systems through a collection of specialized engines.

## The Digital Engine Suite

The suite consists of three primary tools, each focused on a specific aspect of the engineering lifecycle:

### [Engn](engn.md)
The core engine providing foundational CLI utilities and shared libraries. It serves as the baseline for all Digital Engine projects, handling project initialization and core configuration.

### [SysEngn](sysengn.md)
Our Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and User Experience (UX) design tool. `sysengn` enables architects and designers to create consistent, model-driven system definitions and user interfaces.

### [ProjEngn](projengn.md)
The Program Management engine. `projengn` provides tools and workflows for managing schedules, resources, and deliverables within the Digital Engine ecosystem.

## Getting Started

To initialize a new project using the Digital Engine suite, you can start with the `engn` CLI:

```bash
engn init
```

This will set up the necessary project structure and configuration files to begin your engineering journey.
